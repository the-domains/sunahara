LONG SHORT STORY

I had all the cliches to be great: country boy that went to big city, dedicated student, class orator and hired as copywriter one year before graduation. Wow! But then, in the blink of an eye, I caught myself stuck in the same agency and making the same work for almost 5 years. It was time to change.

By that time I had saved enough money to buy a brand new car. But, instead, my choice was to use all of it buying a ticket to the Big Apple and paying some courses there. That changed my entire life: just one day after coming back to Brazil I got a job, and 9 months after I got my dream job. It was the beginning of incredible times of learning and development, that made me ready to face any challenge.

Now, almost four years later, I'm holding a strategic role inside VML's Brazil creative team, working as a senior copywriter. Together with other departments, we seek to deliver to our clients effective and out of the box solutions, based on behaviours, data analysis and creative talent.
